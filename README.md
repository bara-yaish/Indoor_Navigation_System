# QR Code-based Indoor Navigation Application for Blind and Visually Impaired People

Blind and Visually Impaired people face difficulties in their daily lives, and navigating around areas is one of them. The aim of this project is to design and implement an indoor navigation system that uses QR code technology to allow the blind and the visually impaired to travel from one point to another safely and easily inside any architecture without relying on anyone. 

The user of the navigation system scans the QR codes found on the floor next to each checkpoint in a specific location on campus to receive information about the location as well as to request directions towards the desired destination. 

This proposed system allows the user to speak to the application rather than trying to use the necessary means to click on the screen, which creates a mean for the user to communicate without having to go through the trouble to find the options and buttons on the screen. Hence, allowing the user to travel around indoor spaces with comfort and independently.
